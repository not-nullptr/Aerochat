# Aerochat App Host Binary

This folder contains the binary for the Aerochat App Host, which is forked from .NET and licensed under the MIT license.

The `apphost.exe` file found in this directory is built from https://github.com/kawapure/Aerochat-DotNet-Host. It avoids some edge-case silent startup error
issues on Windows 7 hosts lacking the necessary updates to run Aerochat.
